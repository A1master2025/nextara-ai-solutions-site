# NexTara Authority Stack

## Purpose
This document defines the decision hierarchy for NexTara. When two inputs conflict, the higher authority wins. This prevents strategy drift and messaging dilution.

## Level 1 — Supreme Authority
**NexTara SMB Growth Blueprint™**

Owns:
- Strategy and priorities
- Offer/service focus
- ICP definition (who we serve)
- Exclusions (what we will not do)
- Execution sequencing and resource allocation

Non-negotiable rule:
- Messaging and content must serve the Blueprint. Messaging does not lead strategy.

## Level 2 — Controlled Interpreter
**Enterprise-Grade Public Positioning & Messaging Strategy Prompt**

Owns:
- Market-facing language
- Positioning clarity
- Messaging architecture across the site (homepage, services, ads, content themes)
- Tone and readability for SMB decision makers

Constraint:
- May not override Level 1 decisions (ICP, offers, exclusions, channel priorities).

## Operating Guidance
If you feel:
- **Busy but unfocused** → Level 1 problem (Blueprint drift)
- **Clear internally but not converting** → Level 2 problem (Messaging translation)

## Change Control
- Level 1 resets occur quarterly or during major pivots.
- Level 2 updates occur as-needed to improve clarity and conversion, within Level 1 constraints.
